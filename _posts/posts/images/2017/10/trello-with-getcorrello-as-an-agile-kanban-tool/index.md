After initially using Trello with ‘[Scrum for Trello’](http://scrumfortrello.com)' to run our companies Agile process and having to manually create burn downs and release estimates with Excel ([after mangling data from the Trello API and a Google Spread sheet](https://gist.github.com/chrismckelt/a8a7fb7cbf768e1423eb5da15070daa7)) we moved to Trello with GetCorrello (and switched to Kanban after a few months with the teams consent)

Charts from this tool are below.   The GetCorrello team were able to add features on demand. Would use them again!
