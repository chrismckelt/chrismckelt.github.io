# An example user story below

## Title

Wholesale customers to be created as 'on-hold'

## Card

Wholesale customers created in D365 CE will initially have their account status placed 'on hold' to disallow any credit transactions before they have their account credit checked and approved

**Story** As a finance manager I want new wholesale customers to begin with their account status 'oh hold' So that no credit transactions are processed on their account until their account credit checked,approved and taken off hold.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Simple Acceptance Criteria

- new customer accounts created will have an on hold status
- accounts with on-hold status are not able to make purchases (without up front payment by credit card)

#### Specification by Example (for automated tests)

Given a new wholesale customer is created in D365CE When that record is synced with D365FO Then the customer record status will be 'On Hold'

Given a new wholesale customer is created in D365CE When a new purchase order is raised against the customer Then the request is denied due to the customer being on hold

Given a new wholesale customer is taken off hold When a new purchase order is raised against the customer Then the request is accepted
