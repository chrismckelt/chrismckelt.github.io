<p>To track versions and manage an environment from deployment to recovery, source control is essential.  Tracking changes, performing peer reviews before merging to the main master branch &amp; the ability to rebuild/recover/revert to a previously known good state ensure quality throughout the process.</p>

<p>Example source control : <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a></p>

<h1 id="continue-integration">Continue Integration</h1>

<p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.</p>

<p>By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.</p>

<p>Running new code through a pipeline of automated tests &amp; peer review before reaching the test/uat environment ensures less regression errors &amp; frustration for QA team.</p>
