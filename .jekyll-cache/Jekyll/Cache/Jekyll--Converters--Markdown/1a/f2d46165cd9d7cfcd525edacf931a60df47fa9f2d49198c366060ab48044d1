<p>Wholesale customers to be created as â€˜on-holdâ€™</p>

<h2 id="card">Card</h2>

<p>Wholesale customers created in D365 CE will initially have their account status placed â€˜on holdâ€™ to disallow any credit transactions before they have their account credit checked and approved</p>

<p><strong>Story</strong> As a finance manager I want new wholesale customers to begin with their account status â€˜oh holdâ€™ So that no credit transactions are processed on their account until their account credit checked,approved and taken off hold.</p>

<p>Given a new wholesale customer is created in D365CE When that record is synced with D365FO Then the customer record status will be â€˜On Holdâ€™</p>

<p>Given a new wholesale customer is created in D365CE When a new purchase order is raised against the customer Then the request is denied due to the customer being on hold</p>
